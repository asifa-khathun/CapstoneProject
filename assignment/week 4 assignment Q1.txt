For this assignment, I have taken the business problem as folows:
London and Maldives are very popular tourist attractions for people all around the 
world. People who prefer to be more classic choose London as their tourist destination
whereas Maldives can be a more realxing tourist destination. For the business problem,
the main aim is to help people choose a tourist attraction as their destination based
on their preferences. Some people may even want to migrate to these destinations based
on the facilities or comfort of the tourists. Through our solution, stakeholders can 
make decisions regarding this and can clarify any doubts the tourists may have.
