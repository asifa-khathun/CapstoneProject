Data Description:

We can scrape our data mainly from surfing the internet through reputed websites like
wikipedia. These webpages can get us the information of the neighbourhood's name, name
of the town, postal codes etc. But these pages may lack the exact information of the 
geographical locations. So, to overcome this we can use the ArcGIS API. This will 
help us to know thw exact location in latitude and longitude. For the foursquare API
data, the information obtained per venue would contain name of the neighbourhood, 
latitude, longitude of the neighbourhood, name of the venue, latitude and longitude 
of venue, and category of the venue.
